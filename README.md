# Ex2 Directed Weighted Graph

### this project gives the ability to build WD Graph and preform unique algorithms.
### this project includes 6 folders:

* dataStructures: class for WD Graph

* algorithms: class with algorithms you can use on your WD Graph.

* elements: 2 classes for edges and vertices.

* GUI: option for loading saving and preform algorithms on WD Graph in a GUI window ,(example below).

* Tests:tests for classes- edgeData,nodeData,DGraph,Graph_Algo.

* utils: util auxiliary classes - Point3D, Range, stdDraw.
